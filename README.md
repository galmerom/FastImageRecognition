# FastImageRecognition
**Use for image recognition of a specific unique object in image or video**

Use this repository for  building a deep neural network that can identify a specific object that that is apart of a common object.

**For example:**

Find a specific dog. There are networks that can find dogs in images, but what if you want to find a dog called "chill"?

The building and trainging of the network are done by an easy to use interface.
