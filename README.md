# FastImageRecognition
**Use for image recognition of a specific unique object in image or video**

Use this repository for building a deep neural network that can identify a specific object that is apart of a common object.

**For example:**

Find a specific dog. Some networks can find dogs in images, but what if you want to find a dog called "chill"?

An easy-to-use interface does the building and training of the network. 

Output examples can be found in these 2 youtube videos:
